Preferable stand alone (no browser). I was screwing around with the Long Range Shooting Simulation found online to get familiarized with mils. Here is the range card I am looking at: I need help understanding the last two columns. The second to last I don't get at all, but if I am to take a guess at the last, I would say that, that is the amount of centimeters the bullet will move PER km of wind. Right? The "Wind Mil", I don't get at all. Could someone please explain Do you know what time it is? Can't sleep. There are tabs for that. Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping. Dreams again. Want to fight? - I slipped. - Right. You slipped. As a result of me punching you in the face. I was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face. But you most probably did. Tell me about this dream. Anything new? No. You have to let go of the past. Can't remember my past. It's causing you doubt. And doubt makes you vulnerable. Control it. Learn to control again. You'll.

The further they are, the longer it takes for the sound to reach you. \- Most wildlife will run away if they notice you're using weapons against or close to them, but will usually be cool if you're just passing by. \- You can slightly change your Javelin's position while in "depth of field" So this is a dumb idea that's been floating around in my head for a while and while I know it's never gonna happen, I just feel the need to put it down on paper (or on screen, I guess?) and see what people think of it. #Basic Structure At its core, the game would be either a first-person or third-person shooter, with RPG and tactical/strategy elements.

Hello everyone Today I am putting a request in for a Hunting Simulator that I used to have on Console. My household and I love us a decent hunting game. We spent a lot of time playing various Cabelas games with great enjoyment. We are doomed to a geographical region with pathetic hunting opportunities so this is the best we get. This game does have mostly negative reviews but as stare, I did own it on console and know what to expect.

Why take your empty magazine out then store it, then load a fresh mag? Take your new mag out first, and with the same hand take out your empty # MAME 0.205 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=464) With Christmas just over, it’s time for the final MAME release for 2018, and what a year it’s been! Before we move on, let’s pause and recap some of the significant milestones from the past twelve months: We’ve emulated a steady stream of hand-held games from Nintendo, Tiger and others. Our Tiger Game.com emulation now runs all released games. Acorn computer emulation improvements have been too numerous to count. In particular Thomas Black was born in Longview, TX to to a mother who loved him dearly, and a father who expected greatness from him in every aspect of his life. At age 16, his mother died from drinking a bit too much, which caused her to never wake up from being blacked out. At the funeral, something in Thomas's mind shattered. Every time he shed tears about his mother in front of his father, he would be beaten senseless. When he joined the Army after high school, his Drill Sergeant demanded to know, "WHAT. 
I know it's been a while but life continues to be miserable for scheduling free time. Thankfully we have holidays for that! And I've used mine to write and try and get back into the flow!

We begin our month with a triple reveal of Hitman Season 1, Hollow Knight and 7 Days to Die. I think I’m most excited for the first two games but I wouldn’t mind sinking my teeth into a zombie survival game. As it so happens, I already own both Resident Evil Revelations and the original Dead Island and Hard Reset I can’t say I’m looking forward to playing the first game but maybe I can blow off some steam The Squadron attends a briefing for a dangerous raid into Borja territory. \--- The Shield of Kalador returned to home fleet with little fanfare. Unlike the Light of Esha who was low on Jump fuel from its long patrol, the Shield of Kalador had enough reserves to make the micro jumps to reunite with the Home Fleet. Reports were sent and the various crewmembers put their names in a queue to do video calls with their friends and family back in the home fleet. The Light This post is an idea that I've been typing up over the course of the last week or so. I would love an open discussion and I'm open to suggestions for improvements. This is a work in progress so any issues or conflicts can be fixed or corrected. This post is extremely long so I understand if you take pieces and type a question or response that is actually answered later in the post. amp#x200B; I tried to add on spectrum, but it was too long lol. https://robertsspaceindus. I had to divide this post up into three parts because of how long it was, with this being part one while part two and part three are posted in the comments below, so be sure to read those too after reading this. Part One Hello everyone, I know the title of this post may sound weird, but this is something I feel like I should share as an Evangelion fan. Recently, I had a rather interesting dream involving the story of the Rebuild movies. It wasn't just your average The joint taskforce setup Abwell's expertly crafted ambush. \--- The three ships that made up our ambush taskforce started making hyperspace jumps. I was thankful that my separate computer core did not require me to go into hibernation while the calculations were being done. The squadron was cycling through the simulator, practicing their roles in the operation or revisiting previous eight on four encounters. I put some time in the simulator to reassure my fellow pilots I took the upcoming.
